## Work Experience

**Senior Data Scientist** @ [HDFC Life Insurance Ltd](https://www.hdfclife.com/) _(July 2020 - Present)_ <br>
**Data Scientist** @ [HDFC Life Insurance Ltd](https://www.hdfclife.com/) _(July 2019 - June 2020)_ <br>
  - Built an OCR engine for KYC documents like Voter ID, Passport, PAN, Aadhaar using OpenCV, Tesseract, YOLO, Flask, Docker, Jenkins etc to transform digital journey for customer on- boarding. The API is built around deep learning based models for Image ID Classification, Text Extraction, Orientation& Skew correction and Image Quality enhancement.
  - Developed a multi-lingual conversational NLP chatbot for customer queries using RoBERTa, Siamese Neural Network, Universal Sentence Encoder, Spacy, FastText, Google Translate API, FastApi for intent detection and Named Entity Recognition(NER) of user queries. Successful in reducing the calls to helpline by a whooping 70%. Also, implemented a sentiment analysis using gensim, tf-idf vectorize and Random Forest classifier to classify and monitor customer satisfaction of chatbot interactions.
  - Developed an Age, Gender and BMI Predicting model from a selfie using Transfer Learning on VGG-19 CNN model. The idea is to spur millennials to engage with Life Insurance, successfully resulting in 20% rise in policies sold to the targeted demographics.
  - Created a heart Arrhythmia detection model from ECG to reduce the time taken in Insurance underwriting. Trained using a 34 layer CNN on arbitrary length ECG time series.
